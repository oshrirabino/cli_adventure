title: Bound by Magic

[CONTENT]
You speak the binding words with clear intent.
Chains of pale fire coil from the storm and lock around the Wizard's arms and throat.
He screams as the spell folds him into a shard of black glass.
The winds settle. Far below, watchfires relight across the valley.
You have broken his rule and saved the realm.
