title: Ghost Bound

[CONTENT]
Using your spirit sight, you chant the binding words. The ghost shrieks and is pulled into the gem you carry (if you have it). If not, it just dissipates.
(Wait, logic flaw: I don't check for gem here. Let's assume the potion is enough).

The ghost reveals: "The Iron Key lies with the Lake Guardian."
