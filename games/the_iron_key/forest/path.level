[CONTENT]
Ebonwood swallows sound.
Branches knit overhead, turning day to twilight.
Now and then you see old iron nails hammered into trunks, each bent as if twisted by hand.
Ahead, the path forks around a moss-covered standing stone.

[OPTIONS]
Go towards the clearing -> ./clearing.level
Investigate the howling -> ./wolf.level
Return to the road -> ../start.level
