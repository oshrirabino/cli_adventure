[CONTENT]
The trees part without wind.
Moonlight spills over a circular clearing where an altar of black stone waits in the center.
Runes pulse across it in slow intervals, like breathing.
To the north, a jagged opening in the cliff exhales cold air from deep underground.

[OPTIONS]
Examine the altar -> ./altar.level
Enter the cave -> ./cave_entrance.level
Go back to path -> ./path.level
