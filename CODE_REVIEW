🔴 Critical Bugs

   1. Uncaught Exception on Missing Level File (Crash)
       * Location: src/engine/engine.cpp (in Engine::run) and src/parser/tag_parser.cpp (in TagParser::parse_file).
       * Issue: TagParser::parse_file throws a std::runtime_error if it cannot open a file. The Engine::run loop calls parser_.parse_file(context.current_level_path())
         but does not wrap this call in a try-catch block.
       * Impact: If a level file contains a typo in a path to the next level (e.g., option -> ../typo/next.level), the entire game engine will crash with an unhandled
         exception, terminating the program immediately instead of showing an error message or handling the failure gracefully.

   2. Terminal State Corruption on Signal (Ctrl+C)
       * Location: src/ui/terminal_menu.cpp (class ScopedRawMode).
       * Issue: The ScopedRawMode class uses RAII to restore terminal settings (re-enable ECHO and ICANON) in its destructor. However, if the program receives a signal
         like SIGINT (Ctrl+C) while waiting for input in pick_option_interactive, the program terminates immediately without calling the destructor.
       * Impact: The user's terminal will be left in a broken state (invisible typing, no line buffering) after quitting the game, requiring them to run reset to fix
         it.

  🟡 Code Smells & Potential Issues

   1. Infinite Re-parsing Loop
       * Location: src/engine/engine.cpp.
       * Issue: In Engine::run, if a level's execute method finishes without requesting a next level and without setting the "game over" or "victory" flags, the loop
         continues. Since context.current_level_path() hasn't changed, the engine will re-parse, re-render, and re-execute the same level file indefinitely.
       * Recommendation: The engine should likely check if the state has changed or enforce that a level must result in a transition or termination.

   2. Hardcoded Menu Line Calculation
       * Location: src/levels/choice_level.cpp.
       * Issue: ChoiceLevel::execute calls renderer_.clear_last_scene(out, labels.size() + 2);. This + 2 is a magic number assumed to match the implementation details
         of adventure::ui::pick_option (prompt line + newline after selection). If pick_option changes its output format, the screen clearing will be incorrect.

   3. Ambiguous Arrow Parsing
       * Location: src/parser/tag_parser.cpp.
       * Issue: split_option supports both -> and =>. If a line contains both, it prioritizes -> regardless of position. While likely intentional, it could lead to
         confusion if user content contains -> as part of the text but uses => for the delimiter.
